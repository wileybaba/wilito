When I first dove deep into the world of front end web development, I was astonished at the immense amount of open-source frameworks and tool sets that were at my disposal.  How was I to choose between learning Angular, Vue, or React?  What about Ember or Backbone or any of the other lesser known Javascript frameworks?  I decided to take a pragmatic approach and learn everything I could about vanilla JavaScript before building out anything beyond a "Hello World" with the hot new new.

By building out a front-end without a any libraries (and because I had built the backend myself), I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how user interfaces actually interact with server side code.  Most importantly, I was able to really learn about modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I was free from the confusion of JSX, unconcerned with prop transformations, and unbothered by odd conditional syntaxes.  I learned about data binding, how to use the fetch API, and how to access and mutate specific data from my database.  Ignorant to the concept of state, I chained If checks to create workable navigation components and barely functional forms.  Those were the good ol' days...before I learned how to use Vue and React.  

While I'm glad I learned how to build UIs without a framework, it is unlikely that I will ever do it again for anything beyond a simple webpage.  Professionally speaking, nearly all modern software shops rely on third party libraries to build applications.  Furthermore, these frameworks are incredibly valuable and in using them, front-end development can be a real joy.  I'd like to provide my insight on two of the most popular JavaScript frameworks, React and Vue.   

I've been working with React lately, and because it has a greater market share and more job opportunities, I'll begin there.  React is the brainchild of Facebook, and as such, it is tailored to fit a set of needs that are unique to massive enterprise applications.  I'm not the biggest fan of React for the following reasons:
    - JSX is unintuitive and sacrifices the native features available to modern HTML and CSS
    - As much as I love JS, using JavaScript for EVERYTHING is not ideal
    - Conditional syntax is not intuitive

I love Vue.  First off, it is a proper open source project not influenced by the needs of Facebook.  I love the separation of template, JavaScript, and CSS within a single component file.  It just makes sense.  Vue's documentation is also excellent and makes it easy to get started.  

With React you can easily create

```JavaScript

```

As much as I enjoy building pretty user interfaces that are sleek and modern, I found it more enjoyable and stimulating to build out backend code.  Writing a server from scratch was actually...fun!  This is likely due to the glory of Node.js and the expansive libraries of code at my disposal written my much smarter and more experienced engineers.

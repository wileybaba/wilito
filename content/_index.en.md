**Welcome to my website.** I'm a software engineer with a background in economics and ecological agriculture.  I am fascinated by human-computer interaction and I enjoy building things things that help people interface with the real world.  I also make pottery and compose music when I'm not writing code or enjoying the great outdoors.

**Lately,** I've been spending most of my time building out personal projects but am open to collaborating on other ventures if they pique my interest.  I enjoy writing code in <span class="js">`Javascript`</span> and  <span class="go">`Go`</span>, but also have experience with <span class="python">`Python`</span>, <span class="ruby">`Ruby`</span>, <span class="php">`PHP`</span>, and <span class="csharp">`C#`</span>. Please reach out to me on one of the channels below if you'd like to connect.

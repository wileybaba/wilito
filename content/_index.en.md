**Welcome to my website.** I'm a self taught software engineer and organic farmer.  I'm interested in weather informatics, machine learning, and human-computer interaction.  I closely follow news and research on modern web development and am active in the open source community.  I also create ceramic artwork and play guitar when I'm not coding or working with plants.

**Recently,** I'm spending most of my time building [Powder Intelligence](<https://powderintelligence.com>) but am open to working on other projects if they peak my interest.  I like writing code in `Javascript`, `Python`, and `GO`, but also have experience with `Ruby` and `PHP`. Please reach out to me on one of the channels below if you'd like to connect.
